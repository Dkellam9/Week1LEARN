//TODO: wrote a ceasar cypher and do it up with HTML/CSS if time
//Step 1: write a function for Encrypt that takes a key and word to encrypt
//Step 2: Write a loop to convert string into array, change letters based on the key
//Step 3: determine position of characters in decrypted within alphabet
//Step 4: pull characters out of alphabet based on product of step 3
//Step 5: take positions yielded by previous line, draw characters out of alphabet and convert back into single string
//Step 3: Convert encrypted word back into a string
//Step nil: write an if else to allow position to reset to zero if if it exceeds the 24th place. if newpos > 24, then reset to beginning
// when newpositions resets to zero, needs to add the remainder of the positions to newpositions
function encrypt(key,word) {
